Had to comment out XInputDotNetPure in ItemActionRangedAt.cs

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Audio;
//using XInputDotNetPure;
using Object = UnityEngine.Object;


Using SteamCMD, I grabbed a copy of MacOS version:


Steam>@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType macos
"@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType" = "macos"

Steam>force_install_dir macos

Steam>app_update 251570 vaidate

Then, going into 7DaysToDie.app\Contents\Resources\Data\Managed, copied all the DLL files into a Windows copy of 7 Days to Die

Then use SDX Launcher normally
