This modified SDX.Payload.dll will allow you to skip adding the -sdxconfig= parameter to your 7 Days to Die.exe. It will automatically assume
that the file will exists under 7DaysToDieServer_Data\Managed\settings.ini

This file will be useful if you are attempting to host an SDX mod on a rented server, where you cannot modified the start up parameters.
